Tell us what you found (on this site or elsewhere) and why it didn’t meet your needs. This demonstrates that you’ve taken the time to try to help yourself, it saves us from reiterating obvious answers, and above all, it helps you get a more specific and relevant answer!"

      be_specific_body: "If you ask a vague question, you’ll get a vague answer. But if you give us details and context, we can provide a useful, relevant answer."
